# Calculator (Project 2)

## This is a simple python script that lets you perform different mathematic operations (+ , - , * , / , %) on two integers.

I always wanted to create my own calculator so I used Python to do it.  

All you need to run this program is Python 3. To make sure that you have python 3 installed in your computer, run this command in your terminal/command prompt: 

```bash
python --version
```

If you are using Linux, then you may need to specify Python3
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should receive something similar to this following output:

If you receive an error message, then you should go to this website and follow instructions on how to download python: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download Python3</a>

Once you've setup your python, go ahead and clone this project on your local machine. 

If you already have git installed on your computer, then run this command in your command prompt:

```git
git clone https://github.com/sukhbirsekhon/Calculator.git
```

It will download the project for you in your current directory path. 

You can also download the project in .zip format folder on your local machine from github itself.

Once you've cloned or downloaded the project, run the program using python from cloned project directory

```python
python calc.py
```

First, you will see a welcome message:

```
Welcome to mini Calculator app. Please enter two numbers to get started
```

Then, you will be prompted to enter two integers of your choice and here is an example output for that: 

```
Enter first number (integer only): 3 
Enter second number (integer only): 3 
```

Next, you will be prompted to enter operator of your choice and here is an example output for that: 

```
Now select an operator (+ , - , * , / , %) : +
```

Finally, you will see the result:

```
The result of 3 + 3 is 6
```

Here is an example output for whole script:

```
Welcome to mini Calculator app. Please enter two numbers to get started
Enter first number (integer only): 3 
Enter second number (integer only): 3 
Now select an operator (+ , - , * , / , %) : + 
The result of 3 + 3 is 6
```

(Note: Integers and the operator will be different for you for obvious reasons)

Voila! You made it! Now, you can use this calculator app for your mathematics endeavors!
